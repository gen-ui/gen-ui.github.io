<li><strong> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></li>

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this&nbsp;privacy notice.</p>
